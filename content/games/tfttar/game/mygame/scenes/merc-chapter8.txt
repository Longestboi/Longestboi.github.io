[head]Chapter: Downtime[/head]

As the days grew colder, an unsettling silence descended upon the once-thriving town south of Davenport, Bexley. There have been rumors spreading of a sinister presence lurking in the nearby forests. Tales of howling in the dead of night and strange sightings haunted the townsfolk. As fear gripped their hearts, the Wolves of Davenport mercenary group receives a distress call.

A series of wolf packs, driven by an unseen force, had launched a relentless invasion. The townspeople were barricaded behind their meager defenses, but the relentless onslaught was pushing them to the brink of despair.

The call for help echoed through the region, reaching the ears of Rip and the rest of the Wolves of Davenport. Upon hearing the dire news, Rip Daring takes his team to face this formidable threat. 

As you made your way towards the town, the wind carried the chilling howls of the wolves, foreboding what awaited them in the shadowy woods.

Approaching the outskirts of the beleaguered town, you spot two enormous figures leading the wolf packs - Direwolves. Their red eyes glow like embers, and their sinister intelligence is evident in their every move.

“Direwolves aren’t known for straying this far away from their homes. Something must have happened.” Rip comments.

As you approach the town, a scene of chaos and despair unfolds before your eyes. Smoke billows from homes set ablaze, the acrid scent filling the air. The distant sound of terrified cries and the clash of metal against fang echos through the streets, a cacophony of fear and desperation. 

Upon entering the town's outskirts, you and your companions are met with a harrowing sight. Buildings lay in ruins, their once vibrant facades reduced to rubble. Panic-stricken townsfolk scurry through the streets, seeking shelter from the onslaught of the wolf packs.

The air is thick with tension, the weight of impending doom hanging heavily in the atmosphere. Rip Daring, ever the steadfast leader, surveys the scene with a mix of determination and concern etched upon his face. His eyes meet yours before he looks at the rest of the party. Silently conveying the gravity of the situation. With a resolute nod, Rip motioned for the party to fan out, his eyes scanning for signs of the Direwolves and their relentless minions.

You find a direwolf and a small pack of wolves surrounding a house. You can feel the adrenaline surge through your veins, senses sharpening as you prepare to face the ferocious onslaught. 

Gripping your weapon tightly, you took a deep breath, drawing upon the training and the camaraderie of your mercenary comrades. 

In this moment, the fate of the town hung in the balance, and the Wolves of Davenport stood as the last line of defense against the encroaching darkness.
