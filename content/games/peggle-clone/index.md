# A Peggle clone
My clone of Peggle is written in the Godot game engine, and utilizes many of Godot's features, like type hints, which speeds up GDScript as it doesn't need to find a given type, signals, an implementation of the _[observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)_, and more.

This clone was made during the downtime of a game programming internship, as the client was unable to complete the GDD during the internship period.
