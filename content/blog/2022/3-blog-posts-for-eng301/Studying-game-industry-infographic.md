# Infographic about the Games industry
{{< indent >}}Finding an infographic about the part of the games industry I am going into was challenging. So challenging I could not find one. So, I have chosen a more generic infographic to analyze.{{< /indent >}}

<!-- Infographic -->
{{< figure src="https://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Final-EF-Infographic.png" width="100%" attr="Attributions: [The EAS](https://www.theesa.com/resource/2021-essential-facts-about-the-video-game-industry/)." >}}

<!-- Analysis -->
## Analysis of the infographic:
{{< indent >}}The average age of the games consumer, according to the figure above, is 31 years old; This can be important when you are developing a game as some aspects of the game may not be captivating to that audience. Of course, nobody says you have to target the average video game player.{{< /indent >}}
{{< indent >}}An interesting thing that many may not seem important is that 45 percent of all players identify as female; This, to me, is interesting as games are, generally, not targeted toward women, and if they are, they are for small children.{{< /indent >}}
{{< indent >}}Though targeting games toward women would likely backfire, as it could many would see it as pandering, many women do not play games that use this sort of targeting.{{< /indent >}}
