# Gaining Employment in Games Programming

{{< indent >}}Gaining employment in the game programming industry can be tricky. A degree in game programming often makes it easier for you to get hired in the game industry. That is because the degree effectively vouches for you.{{< /indent >}}

{{< indent >}}If you are not college educated, the likelihood of getting a job decreases dramatically, and the only way to get past this is to have released games under your belt.{{< /indent >}}

<!-- With College Degree -->
## With College Degree:
{{< indent >}}With a college degree, people are more likely to assume your accreditations. Typically, though, graduating from colleges that offer game programming degrees, you need to make a game. And you are more likely to get hired if you have a higher number of polished games on your resume.{{< /indent >}}

<!-- Without College Degree -->
## Without College Degree:
{{< indent >}}Without a college degree, it is a requirement to have made more polished games or hope your game gets incredibly popular. More recently, however, the focus of game consumers has shifted to indie games. And from what some professors at {{< title "University of Advancing Technology" "UAT" >}} have said, working in indie games, then going to the industry is relatively common today.{{< /indent >}}
