# A Day in the Life of a Game Programmer
{{< indent >}}While I could have found a video about a day in the life of an American game developer, I have already seen "Day in the Life of a Japanese Game Programmer," so I would like to introduce this video to you.{{< /indent >}}

{{< indent >}}The video goes through many things that aren't video game industry-related, but regardless, it shows that video game programmers are normal people.{{< /indent >}}
