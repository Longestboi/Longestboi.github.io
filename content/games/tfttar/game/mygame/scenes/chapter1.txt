Nestled on the outskirts of Davenport, far beyond the city's bustling streets and grand architecture, lies a serene farmstead. This picturesque land stretches across acres of fertile soil and rolling fields, offering a tranquil respite from the urban chaos. The farmstead serves as the backdrop for your upbringing and sets the stage for your journey.

The farm is a place where hard work and dedication intersect with the rhythms of nature. Fields of vibrant crops sway in the wind, their colors blending together to form a breathtaking tapestry. Rows of vegetables, fruits, and grains stretch as far as the eye can see, a testament to the labor poured into the land. At the heart of the farmstead stands a quaint farmhouse, weathered by time but filled with warmth and love. It is here that your character was raised, nurtured by the unwavering devotion of your parents. The aroma of home-cooked meals often wafts through the air, a testament to your mother's culinary skills and her ability to transform the farm's bounty into delicious feasts.

Your parents are pillars of strength and determination. A seasoned farmer, your mother possesses an uncanny understanding of the land and an unwavering commitment to its care. She has imparted her knowledge and love for the farm to you, teaching you the secrets of cultivating crops and tending to livestock. Together, you have toiled under the sun, sowed seeds, and reaped the rewards of your labor. The farmstead is more than just a source of sustenance; it's a sanctuary. The wide-open spaces invite exploration and introspection.

Your father is often on trips to Davenport. He is a sailor that takes food and other goods down the river to Davenport or smaller towns that can’t grow much. He’s become well known across this side of Teville.

I hid them from you because I wanted it to be a scavenger hunt, but since you found them before I came back you can have them.”

				Your father would sometimes come back with toys or treats from out of town. He tries to get you some of your favorite bread baked by the dwarves. They bake the best bread you have ever had and whenever he leaves that is the one thing you ask from him.

				“What did you find in there?” Your mother calls out.

				“Wooden swords and a note from Dad!” You shout back.

				“Oh, you found the hidden compartment, I told your dad that you would find it. He needs to find better hiding places.” Your mother laughs. “You can play with them after you get back from the market. I need you to pick up some food.”

*page_break

Navigating through the marketplace requires a keen sense of observation and adaptability. The bustling crowd, composed of locals and visitors alike, weaves through the maze of stalls, creating a dynamic flow of movement. People from all walks of life can be seen here, dressed in a myriad of vibrant and diverse attire, representing their cultural heritage and personal styles.

		They stop you in your tracks and ask, "Hey there, ${name} and Reese, what are you two doing here by yourselves?" 

		"Mother needs me to pick up various food items for supper tonight." You respond.

		The Elf nods, understanding your task. "Ah yes," they say, their voice tinged with a hint of wisdom. "While I don't have everything you need, I know that Ferren has the remaining goods you require. Go see them first, and I'll have the rest of what you need by the time you get back." With directions in mind, you head towards the vendor. As you approach their stall, they greet you warmly. "Well hello there, little human. What can I do for you today?"
		*page_break

		“I need to get vegetables for dinner tonight. Our harvest is late and we can’t pick them yet.” You explain as well as you can.

		"I can provide you with what you need, but first, I have a few minor tasks that require your expertise. I will even let you choose which tasks you would like to complete." With determination, you and Reese embark on the tasks assigned by the vendor, immersing yourself in the challenges they present.

		*fake_choice
			# The Strongarm Delivery ([color=${brawn_color}]Brawn++[/color] [color=${cunning_color}]Cunning++[/color])

				The Elf considers your request for a moment before speaking, "Ah, yes. While I don't have everything you need, I know that a trusted merchant named Gorrim down the lane has the remaining goods you require. However, before I can assist you further, I have a task that requires you to be strong and smart. Although, with the two of you working together, it shouldn’t be that difficult."

				“He is right down this path, but be careful. The crate is very heavy and there are many obstacles along the way. You will need to find a way to work together if you want to deliver this.” The Elf explains. 
				*page_break

				Your task is clear: deliver the crate to the designated merchant without damaging its contents and without falling into any traps or pitfalls along the way. As you carry the weight on your shoulders, your muscles strain and your brawn is put to the test. 

				“I can help! You don’t have to carry it by yourself.” Reese offers, but you shake your head.

				“This is my task, just help me not bump into anything.” You request. Reese runs ahead and tells you where some obstacles are.

				When the two of you get back, the Elf imparts their knowledge of combat tactics and strategic thinking, honing both your brawn and cunning skills.

			# The Agile Pursuit ([color=${agility_color}]Agility++[/color] [color=${cunning_color}]Cunning++[/color])
				"There's been an incident in the marketplace where a mischievous pickpocket has been causing trouble. I need one of you to catch them before they slip away using your speed and outsmarting them." The Elf explains.

				“From what I have heard, they are a sneaky fellow. From what I have gathered, they are shorter than a dwarf and wear a dark hood. They keep out of sight, but find ways to move through the crowd. If the two of you work together, you will be able to find and catch them.” The Elf explains before you and Reese join the crowd.

				Your mission is to navigate through the bustling marketplace, swiftly and deftly, in pursuit of the pickpocket. Your agility and quick reflexes will be crucial in catching them, but you must also employ cunning tactics to outsmart their tricks and evasive maneuvers.
				*page_break

				As you two dart through the marketplace, jumping over obstacles, maneuvering through tight spaces, and blending seamlessly with the flow of people, you must also anticipate the pickpocket's moves and set cunning traps of your own. By strategically positioning yourself and using your wits, you gradually close in on the pickpocket, outmaneuvering them at every turn. Reese follows close behind you, ready to block any escape routes that may pop up. 

				With a final burst of speed and a well-placed trap, you apprehend the pickpocket, returning the stolen goods to their rightful owners. The Elf commends your agile and cunning pursuit, impressed by your ability to think on your feet and adapt to the ever-changing circumstances.

				In recognition of your accomplishment, the Elf imparts their knowledge of stealth techniques and cunning strategies, enhancing your agility and cunning.

		With a nonchalant smile, you respond, "Just browsing." The Elf nods, seemingly understanding your desire to explore the marketplace without any particular goal in mind. They offer you a nod of acknowledgement before continuing on their way, leaving you to your own devices.

Understanding their intent, you respond, "Well, I seem to be running low on food. I have various crops and items to trade."

		The Elf's eyes sparkle with interest, and they invite you to showcase your offerings. Together, you examine the items you have brought, discussing their worth and potential trade possibilities. Reese watches as you trade, not understanding how you do this. 
		*page_break

		After negotiating, you strike a deal, exchanging your crops and items for much-needed food supplies. With the trade completed, the Elf presents you with the acquired provisions and a thoughtful smile. "Thank you for your business," they say. "However, if you're looking to fully settle into the marketplace, I have a few minor tasks that require your expertise. Completing them will grant you additional skills, further honing your abilities. I will let you choose which task you wish to complete for me."

		Grateful for the opportunity, you eagerly accept the challenge and embark on the tasks assigned by the Elf. With each successful completion, you acquire new knowledge and grow.

				The elf sends the two of you to get some cloth from the merchant on the other side of town. However, before you leave, he gives a warning.
				
				“Be careful of the people called the Whisper. They may be known for having some good information, but they can’t be trusted.” The Elf tells you before sending you both off.

				As you wander through the market, you notice a shady figure lurking in the shadows. Intrigued, you approach them cautiously, discovering that they are the Whisper. Whisper specializes in acquiring valuable secrets and information, and they have something that piques your interest.
				*page_break

				Whisper offers you a deal – in exchange for a favor, they will share valuable secrets that can aid you in your journey. The favor they require involves using your cunning to gather classified information from various individuals in the market. You are cautious  at first, but Reese thinks it may prove useful to stay on their good side. They provide you with a list of targets and specific questions to ask them discreetly.

				Your task is to navigate the bustling market, using your cunning to approach the targets, engage them in conversation, and extract the desired information without arousing suspicion. You must rely on your ability to read people, employ persuasive tactics, and adapt to each target's personality and demeanor.

				Many times you and Reese have to find creative hiding spots. A few times even creating some. The two of you will push a barrel into a better location or climb a difficult wall.

				With your natural gift for cunning and strength, you successfully gather the information Whisper seeks, impressing them with your cleverness and resourcefulness. In return, Whisper imparts invaluable knowledge of covert operations and cunning strategies.

After a hearty dinner with Mom, you head to bed with a book. It’s a journal of everything you have found. You have a section for monsters, locations, people and items, each categorized with their own bookmark.

You open your book and add in a new creature you learned about today. The mockguarden. While you and Reese were running around town, you overheard some travelers talking about it.

“I’d be careful walking down the main road to Lindow if I were you. Heard that it’s been overrun by mockgardens.” One merchant said to another. “Take the side path between Stormdenn and the river, it’s a longer path, but safer.”

After hearing about the creature, you asked Reese to stop by the library so you could read about it. They agreed, as long as you played knights with them.

At the library, you searched for the book about monsters and flipped through the pages. You see a wide array of monsters you have never heard of, but you only had time to read about one.
You choose to read:

With its ability to adapt and camouflage, it poses a significant threat to unsuspecting creatures that venture too close.

		“The Manned Jackaloids are small, werewolf-like creatures that inhabit remote regions far from civilized settlements. Standing between 3 and a half to just under 5 feet tall, they operate in packs, using their presence to frighten away other predators from potential prey and scavenging off decaying carcasses. Despite their frail and lesion-ridden appearance, these creatures exhibit surprising resilience.

Far surpassing the mere size of their smaller kin, these majestic beings exhibit a level of intelligence that sets them apart from regular wolves.

You are enthralled by the readings before you can finish reading, the book is torn from your hands.

“This isn’t something someone so young to read about. There is much more appropriate creature books over in the kids section.” The librarian explains with a rude voice.

You and this librarian have never got along. Every time you find a new book, she will snatch it from your hands and send you to the kids section. You are old enough to buy food and sell crops, why are you not allowed to read about the creatures of this world?

“Come on ${name}, let’s just go play. It isn’t worth angering Miss Librarian.” Reese drags you out of the library and into the town.
