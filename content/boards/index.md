# GAME PROGRAMMING DEGREE OBJECTIVES (WIP)

### 1. Implement multiple completed games, including 3D games, using common tools, languages, and software for web, console, PC, or mobile platforms.

{{< boards-section "brick-breaker" "Brick Breaker" "/games/brick-breaker" "./brick-breaker.webp" "Written in Python in a week. (Runs anywhere Python can, like web browsers, Windows, Linux, and macOS)" >}}

{{< boards-section "maze-cubed" "MAZE<sup>CUBED</sup>" "/games/maze-cubed" "./maze_cubed.webp" "3D Maze game made in Unreal Engine 4.21. (Runs Windows, and Linux, Could run on macOS, but no builds)." >}}

{{< boards-section "collect-coin" "Collect The Coin" "/games/collect-the-coin" "" "Written in Python. (Runs anywhere Python can, Windows, Linux, and macOS, except for web browsers due to performance issues)" >}}

{{< boards-section "long-ninja" "Long Titled Ninja Game" "https://longestboi.itch.io/long-title-ninja" "./lone-ninja.webp" "A top-down 3d shooter in Unity. (Runs on Windows, and Linux. Could run on macOS, but no builds)" >}}

{{< dots >}}

### 2. Design, develop, and implement the architecture and infrastructure needed to support a complete game project.

{{< boards-section "collect-coin" "Collect The Coin" "/games/collect-the-coin" "" "Built with the Pygame framework, it’s a side-scrolling platformer made from scratch." >}}

{{< boards-section "pytris" "Pytris" "/games/pytris" "./Pytris.webp" "Built with the Pygame framework, from scratch, to be as modular as possible." >}}

{{< dots >}}

### 3. Implement and analyze fundamental data structures and algorithms associated with game applications supporting gameplay mechanics.

{{< boards-section "pytris" "Pytris" "/games/pytris" "./Pytris.webp" "Built with the Pygame framework, from scratch, to be as modular as possible. Implemented a Godot-like signal class, base game objects, state machines, easing functions, etc…" >}}

{{< boards-section "wardog" "Project Wardog" "/games/wardog" "./Wardog.webp" "Built with Ren’Py, I built the dialog system using a tree to easily model how the text would be used in-game." >}}

{{< dots >}}

### 4. Use software development processes to analyze a project problem, and to design, build, and test a corresponding software solution.

{{< boards-section "wardog" "Project Wardog" "/games/wardog" "./Wardog.webp" "I built out the tooling to take the dialog that was written in a spreadsheet by the designers and generate a Python file that assigns the dialog text to a variable that can be used by the programmers in-game." >}}

{{< boards-section "tfttar" "Tales From Teren: The Approaching Rot" "/games/tfttar" "./TFTTAR.webp" "The framework that _Tales From Teren_ is built on uses a very limited custom language. To get around many of the issues I had, like having functions that you can’t pass variables into, I modeled out a system that allows you to store variables in global memory, exactly like how CPUs do it at a low level." >}}

{{< dots >}}

### 5. Demonstrate development skills using multiple programming languages, development environments, and platforms, including advanced and/or experimental topics in game programming.

{{< boards-section "tfttar" "Tales From Teren: The Approaching Rot" "/games/tfttar" "./TFTTAR.webp" "Web-based visual novel that needed to run on desktop and mobile browsers." >}}

{{< boards-section "pytris" "Pytris" "/games/pytris" "./Pytris.webp" "One of the more complex engines I’ve written in Python due to a lack of time constraints. Contains things like Godot-like signals, GUI objects, global data, and high framerates for an interpreted language." >}}

{{< dots >}}

### 6. Establish collaboration, mentorship, and professional leadership skills by working with other disciplines to deliver highly polished and completed projects.

{{< boards-section "tfttar" "Tales From Teren: The Approaching Rot" "/games/tfttar" "./TFTTAR.webp" "I was the main developer for _Tales From Teren_ for its first semester and implemented many features that the designers, writers, and artists needed, some of which never made it into the project." >}}

{{< boards-section "biomines" "Biomines" "" "./biomines.webp" "I worked as a programming advisor for the first semester of the project. I advised how the repos should be set up, including file structure, how the project settings should be, and more." >}}
