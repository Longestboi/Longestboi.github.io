# A Tetris Clone
_Not Tetris_ was made in (roughly) 6 weeks, off and on, for an introductory Python class. All the assets, besides the music and 4-line clear, were made by myself. The game is built in Python & Pygame; As well, all the features of this game are made from scratch, only using observations from the Gameboy and NES versions of Tetris.

This game has many downfalls, including that it isn't finished, but for what it is, I'm quite proud of my performance in the making of this game.

## Functional Prototype
This was the first build that was "playable." There are quite a few errors in this build, mostly because I was in a rush to get it submitted.

# Critical Points
While the game is in a good place, it's ultimately unfinished. There are also a few bugs, namely with the collision detection when rotating.
