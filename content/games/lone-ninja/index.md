# Top-down Shooter
In this game, you play as a ninja forced to defect because he was assigned to assassinate a close friend. When you refuse to assassinate this friend, your clanmates, not knowing that your target is a friend, force you out of the clan and start to hunt you down. If they had known the target was close to you, they likely would have reassigned the assassination to someone else.

Also, ninjas have guns, for some reason.
