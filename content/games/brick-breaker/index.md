# A Brick Breaker Made in a Week

This game was made in a week for a thinking strategies class. The course offered students a project-oriented, cross-disciplinary approach to applied thinking strategies, including critical, systems, creative, lateral, and parallel thinking, with assignments and projects guiding us toward an understanding of how these thinking dimensions related to our intended disciplines in emerging technology industries and our personal educational aspirations.

## Expectations of the assignment

The expectations of the assignment were:
{{< rawhtml >}}
<ul style="--REQ-SPACING: .3em;">
  <li>The game level is playable.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: var(--REQ-SPACING);">Background art</li>
  <li style="margin-top: var(--REQ-SPACING);">At least 10 structures/obstacles/enemies (depending on the game type)</li>
  <li style="margin-top: var(--REQ-SPACING);">Character with at least two frames of animation</li>
  <li style="margin-top: var(--REQ-SPACING);">At least 1 item in the game must be your artwork (background, structures, enemies, character)</li>
  <li style="margin-top: var(--REQ-SPACING);">The game level must take at least 30 seconds to complete</li>
  <li style="margin-top: var(--REQ-SPACING);">The player must be able to succeed or fail the level</li>
  <li style="margin-top: var(--REQ-SPACING);">The level must include at least 5 different sound effects for 5 different events (collisions, jumps, collect objects, etc.)</li>
</ul>

I believe I accomplished all the expectations for this assignment as I got {{< title "185/185" "100%" >}} on it.

## Critical Points

Because it was made in a week and I didn't work on it afterward, there are a few bugs.

The most prominent one is the collision issue. Another is the sound effects playing over each other.

# Play It!

{{< itch userName="longestboi" gameTitle="brick-breaker">}}

The game and it's source is available on my [itch.io](https://longestboi.itch.io/brick-breaker) page. The game can even be played in-browser! It's not exactly representative of the game on the desktop, but it works well.
